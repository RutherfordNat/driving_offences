Driving offence data for NZ - sourced from police.govt.nz

Original file -

The following code reads different sheets from the spreadsheet, combining data for offences and fines by each offence type. There's a main data frame `offences_and_fines` which contains this set.

Note - Sheets are hardcoded, hence tests must be done to double check total values.

### Red Light Offences

```{r red_light, echo=FALSE}
