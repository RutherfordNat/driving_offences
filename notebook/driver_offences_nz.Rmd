Driving offence data for NZ - sourced from police.govt.nz

Original file -

The following code reads different sheets from the spreadsheet, combining data for offences and fines by each offence type. There's a main data frame `offences_and_fines` which contains this set.

Note - Sheets are hardcoded, hence tests must be done to double check total values.


```{r load_libraries, include=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("readxl"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("ggplot2"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("ggthemes"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("lubridate"))
```


### Red Light Offences

```{r red_light, echo=FALSE}

red_light_sheet <- read_excel("../data/road-policing-driver-offence-data-jan2009-sep2006.xlsx")
